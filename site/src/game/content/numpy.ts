    body: 'Stack the thrusters as the columns of one array: `T = np.column_stack([v, w, u])`.\n\n- `np.linalg.matrix_rank(T)` counts the independent directions: **2** for the first two thrusters, **3** once the new mount is on. Add the spare and it stays 3: the spare adds nothing.\n- `np.linalg.solve(T, b)` returns the dials that reach `b`, in one call.\n- `v + w`, `3 * v` and `np.linalg.norm(v)` are your `add`, `scale` and `length`.\n\n**Yours and theirs:** your `reachable` tries 40,401 dial settings and stops at −10 to 10. NumPy solves for the dials directly in compiled code, with row swaps for accuracy, and handles any size. You will build that method yourself in Chapter 10.',
    code: 'import numpy as np\nT = np.column_stack([[1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 2]])\nprint(np.linalg.matrix_rank(T), np.linalg.solve(T, [1, 1, 0]))',

    kind: 'numpy', title: 'Measuring in NumPy',
    body: '- `v @ w` (or `np.dot(v, w)`) is the dot product: your `dot`.\n- `np.cross(a, b)` is the cross product: your `cross`.\n- `np.linalg.norm(v)` is the length; `v / np.linalg.norm(v)` makes it one unit long.\n- `np.linalg.det(np.column_stack([a, b, c]))` is the scalar triple product of three struts: your `triple`.\n- A whole strut scan in one line: `np.einsum('ij,ij->i', U, np.cross(V, W))` gives every node's triple product at once.\n\n**Yours and theirs:** `np.linalg.det` does not use the triple-product formula. It uses a method you will meet in Act III, which stays accurate for large matrices.',

  3: {
    kind: 'numpy', title: 'Solving in NumPy',
    body: '`np.linalg.solve(A, b)` answers "where do the planes meet?" in one call.\n\nIt does what your `row_echelon` and `back_sub` do, with one change: **partial pivoting**. Before clearing each column it swaps up the row with the largest entry, so rounding errors cannot grow. It calls LAPACK, a library tuned since the 1970s.\n\n**Yours and theirs:** `solve` refuses a system with no single answer (it raises an error). Your `solve` says **none**, **one** or **many**, and gives the directions of the many. When readings disagree and no exact answer exists, NumPy offers `np.linalg.lstsq`: the closest answer. You will meet the idea behind it in Act VIII.',
    code: 'import numpy as np\nA = np.array([[1., 1, 1], [1, -1, 2], [2, 1, -1]]); b = np.array([6., 5, 1])\nprint(np.linalg.solve(A, b))',

And `np.linalg.det` of the Collapse readings returns about 0.004: a number, not a verdict. Deciding what counts as zero is still your job.',

    kind: 'numpy', title: 'Rank in NumPy',
    body: '`np.linalg.matrix_rank(A)` counts the directions that survive.\n\nIt does **not** row-reduce. It measures how much the matrix stretches in each direction and counts the stretches bigger than a tiny **tolerance**. That is the two-decimal model in code form: a direction squeezed below the tolerance counts as flattened.\n\nNumPy has no null space function; SciPy does: `scipy.linalg.null_space(A)` and `scipy.linalg.orth(A)` return unit arrows for the null space and the column space, found the same way (from the stretches, with a tolerance).\n\n**Yours and theirs:** your `rank` counts pivots exactly. On measured data, the tolerance decides, so the same matrix can have rank 3 or rank 2 depending on how many decimals you trust.',

A change of grid is never a new kind of maths, only a solve and a multiply.',

For big matrices that polynomial is hopeless to solve accurately. Instead it repeats a clever version of your `power_iteration` on all directions at once.\n\n`np.linalg.matrix_power(A, 50)` uses repeated squaring, like your `mat_pow`.',

NumPy uses **reflections** (Householder), which keep the columns square to many more digits. And `lstsq` avoids $A^{\\mathsf T} A$, which would square how much errors in $b$ can grow.',

NumPy works on $A$ directly, which is how the Fold\'s thin direction (singular value 0.0013) stays visible.',
