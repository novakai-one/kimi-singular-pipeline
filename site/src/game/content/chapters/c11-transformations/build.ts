  brief: 'Write `matvec(A, x)`. `A` is a list of rows, such as `[[1, -2], [1, -1]]`. `x` has one number per column of `A`.\n\nReturn $A\\mathbf x$: **the mix of the columns of `A`, with the numbers in `x` as the weights**. Your `lincomb(cs, vs)` from Chapter 2 does the mixing.\n\nThe columns are not stored as lists: column `j` is `[row[j] for row in A]`.\n\nOn Write you may also use the row view: entry `i` is `dot(A[i], x)`, row `i` dotted with `x`.',
