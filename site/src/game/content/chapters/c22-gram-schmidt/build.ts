// Chapter 22 builds (GDD §5.5): gram_schmidt(vs) and qr(A). The Drift fix runs on gram_schmidt at the start
// of every watch. Both answers are canonical: the arrows are taken in order and each keeps the direction of
// what is left of it, so R has a positive diagonal and the swarm compares entry by entry.
// Plain data and maths (no DOM): tests/unit/game-c22.test.ts runs the references in CPython.
