// Chapter 12: "What do two moves in a row do?" (GDD §6.6, node N14).
// The sequence rail: drop moves right to left; the grid plays them in order, then fuses them into
// one matrix. Composition is the matrix product; order matters; grouping does not; the transpose
// moves a matrix across a dot product. Builds: matmul (on your matvec) and transpose.
