# Brief for a chapter builder

You are building chapters of **SINGULAR**, a voiced story game that teaches university linear algebra, in the repo
`/home/user/claude-ai-demo`. The engine, kit and reference chapters exist. You write content on top of them.
The bar is a shipped, best-in-class game: every screen polished, every number right, every sentence plain.

## Read first, in this order (do not skip)
1. `game-design/GDD.md`: §0, §1.4 (tone, two registers), §2 (story bible; **§2.7 truth table**), §3 (loops), §4 (the
   Briefing), §5.5 (functions per chapter), §7 (difficulty), **your chapters in §6 in full**, Appendix C (term ledger),
   Appendix E (mapping onto today's engine).
2. `game-design/AUTHORING.md` — files, beat order → beat kinds, puzzle contract, Briefing contracts, kit table, words, done.
3. `game-design/curriculum.md` — your nodes (question, picture, derivation, by-hand skills, misconceptions, explain-back).
4. `site/src/game/game/types.ts` — the contract. `site/src/game/content/truth.ts` — the story numbers (use them).
5. The reference chapters: `site/src/game/content/chapters/c00-prologue/` and `c01-vectors/`. Match their voice and polish.
6. The kit you will use: `site/src/game/kit/*.ts`, `site/src/game/gfx/*.ts`, `site/src/game/content/common/*.ts`,
   `site/src/game/ui/widgets.ts`. Read the files you use; do not guess APIs.

## What to build
Your chapters exactly as GDD §6 describes them: cold open, chapter card with In short, the See-it puzzles and the aha,
naming beats, the [D] and [H] puzzles, the Briefing (sayit → doubts → law → procedure if listed → compare), the Why-it-matters
card with the cue, the builds (GDD §5.5), and the story-out beat (Case Board pin/answer as listed in GDD §2.3).
Where the GDD is vague, decide, following the house rules. Use the GDD's puzzle numbers and story numbers from `truth.ts`.

**Engine status.** Every beat kind works today, including the Briefing (`card`, `sayit`, `doubt`, `law`, `compare`,
`procedure`): the flow test drives them all. Still **unit-test** the Briefing data (law: the target survives and
near-misses break; doubts: the canonical construction gives the right verdict and the Shake finds the breaking case;
procedures: the reference order succeeds and dropping each key step fails). The geometry and data kits are finished
(`kit/geom.ts`: `Knob`, `RightAngle`, `AngleArc`, `Shadow`, `Sweep`, `UnitCircleImage`; `kit/data.ts`: `PointCloud`,
`FitLine`, `Projector3D`, `PCAView`); the dev chapter `c92-kit-geom` shows each one in use.

**Also in the engine** (use, do not rebuild): the act **Review** beat (`kind: 'review'`, `ReviewDef`: four claims by one
speaker, built like doubts) for act-end chapters; the **Teach Teo** beat (`kind: 'teo'`, `TeoDef` = Procedure + `ask`) for
callbacks T1–T5 (GDD §4.4); the **Broadcast** beat (Epilogue only; data in `content/broadcast.ts`); **installs** through
`pylib.map(fn, cases)` / `pylib.call(fn, ...args)` with `isPlayerFn(fn)` to say whose code ran; the Case Board
`pin` / `answer` and the constellation `lightStar(id)` / `linkStars(a, b)` (game/caseboard.ts, ids in `STARS`).
The act's NumPy card and the catch-up card are automatic. Builds need a `swarm` (AUTHORING.md §5b).

## Craft standards
- The picture does the teaching. Keep scenes uncluttered: at most ~4 arrows, labels never overlapping, readouts for exact numbers.
- Make winning feel good (motion, sound, a short crew line). Make failing teach (the gap drawn, a literal LANTERN bark).
- Small whole numbers first; the GDD's seeded ranges by difficulty. Verify every number with `math/la.ts` / `rref.ts`.
- Story lines are short, in character, no exclamation marks, no banned words, maths objects never personified, and no
  term before its naming beat — in dialogue too (an automated check enforces it game-wide).
- Scenes without their own visuals get the ship exterior automatically; give the important beats their own staging
  (the ark, the Anchor, the buoys, the holotable) with the models in `public/game/models/`.

## Verify (required before you report)
1. `npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json` has no errors in your files.
2. `node --experimental-strip-types --test tests/unit/game-<chapterId>.test.ts` passes (write it).
3. `node tests/game-solve-all.mjs <chapterIds…>` — every puzzle passes at cadet, navigator and commander, no console errors.
   The dev server runs on http://localhost:5173 (no hot reload; new chapter folders are picked up). If it is down, start
   it with `npx vite --port 5173 > /dev/null 2>&1 &` from the repo root.
4. `node tests/game-flow.mjs <chapterId> <scratch dir>` — LOOK at every screenshot with the Read tool and fix what is
   cluttered, overlapping, off-screen, unreadable or ugly. Iterate until it looks shipped.
5. `node tests/game-wording.mjs <chapterId>` reports 0 hits.
6. Interact for real at least once per chapter with a small Playwright script kept in your scratch dir (drag a handle,
   type an answer, press Fire) and confirm the puzzle reacts.

The machine is shared (4 CPU cores, software rendering), so browser tests are slow. Be patient; do not start extra servers.

## Rules
- Create/modify only: `site/src/game/content/chapters/<your chapter dirs>/**` and `tests/unit/game-<chapterId>*.test.ts`.
  Need a reusable component that does not exist? Put it in your chapter folder. Do not edit shared files (kit, engine,
  types, truth, other chapters). If a shared file has a bug or needs a feature, work around it locally and say so.
- Do not commit. The lead reviews and commits.
- The scratchpad is shared with other agents: prefix every scratch file and folder with your chapter id (`c13-flow.mjs`).
- Final report (concise): files; each puzzle with its win condition and solve result per difficulty; codex entries;
  Briefing data written; builds; anything not done; recommended shared-file changes.
